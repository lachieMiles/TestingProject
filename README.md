# 19 Testing: Tech Quiz Test Suite

This week, we built a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhanced it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.
